# Unix Bourne shell script for running perf client tests
# The parameter passed in is a string binding.

# Usage:
#           run_client.sh `string binding returned by server`
#
# An example run of this test involves starting the server:
#        ./server 1 ncadg_ip_udp
#              ==> returns binding, such as ncadg_ip_udp:129.35.130.133[2001]
#         run_client.sh ncadg_ip_udp:129.35.130.133[2001]
